# _Fan Driver MQTT_

This project involves the development of a driver to control a domestic fan using the MQTT protocol, enabling wireless operation. The system is implemented on a microcontroller with RTOS support, utilizing techniques such as timers and interrupts to manage real-time actions.

Thanks to MQTT communication, the fan can be remotely controlled, allowing functionalities such as turning the light on/off and adjusting the fan speed. This approach enhances efficiency and offers a flexible control interface for home automation systems.
